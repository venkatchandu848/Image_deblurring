# Image Deblurring

Image deblurring is a critical task in computer vision, particularly in real-world scenarios such as photography, surveillance, and autonomous driving. In this project, we tackle the image deblurring problem using both **coordinate-based neural networks (WIRE Gaussian)** and **GAN-based methods**, focusing on reconstructing sharp, high-quality images from blurred inputs.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Problem**: Real-world images often suffer from motion blur or defocus blur, leading to loss of visual details. This project aims to restore such images to their original sharpness.
- 🧠 **Methods Used**:
  - **WIRE Gaussian**
  - **GAN-based Deblurring**
  - **Gaussian Fourier representation**
 
- 📏 **Evaluation Metric**:
  - **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** is used to measure the quality of the reconstructed image.
